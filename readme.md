Small app to record and transcript your thoughts. or ideas. or emotions.

## Development
`npx expo install`
`npx expo start`
`npx expo install --check`
`npx expo-doctor`


## next step
- separate screen for note detail view. 

## todo
- integrate firebase OR at least trigger pipeline of transcribe etc. 


## decisions
- asyncstorage vs https://rnfirebase.io -> keep things simpler and think about online integration later.
